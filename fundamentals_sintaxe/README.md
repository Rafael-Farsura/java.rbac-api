### it's was my first contact with java 8 and i...

### felt it looks like C++ a lot, i'm feeling comfortable rn and it makes me lost the ""hate"", but just a little bit for while...

#

# Pre-requisites - ## Java 8

## JDK | JRE | JVM

#

# After java 8 installment.

## - If the build dir isn't exists on : fundamentals_sintaxe/src/build

### - run : `$ javac <File name here>.java ` such as `$ javac HelloWorld.java`

## - It will compile and generate a new file switching the extension from ".java" to ".class"

### - Now it's "izipizi", just run: `$ java <filename>.class ` also like `$ java HelloWorld.java` it will print `Hello World`
